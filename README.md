# 1. User Experience

## 1.1 User Goals

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My goal in creating this website is to broaden people's horizon. I want to either inform or reinforce their knowledge on different topics. The questions in this quiz would do just that. These questions test the user's knowledge of our solar system, the human history, geographical locations, our homeland, planet Earth and much more.

## 1.2 User Expectations

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The website should contain the quiz questions and options for the user to select an answer from. At the end of the quiz, the user should be able to get a feedback from the website regarding their overall score. 
The following are also expected of this website:

* Should be easy to use and accessable on all electronic appliances.
* Should be visually appealing and contain the necessary information for the user regarding how the quiz works.
* The wording of the questions should be easy to understand.
* The amount of time remaining to answer each question should be clearly visible.

### 4.2.2 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html codes of my project. It was used to check if any errors were available and I had to correct them before continuing onto the next step. The image below had to be shown in order to confirm that there is no error in my project.

![Confirmation-HTML]

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check that all the code written in css were correct. The image below tells me that there are no errors present in my code.

* Reference is given to [Coding Nepal](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingNepal) for teaching me how to make a quiz with timer. This was the video I took into consideration and I took some bllocks of code from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk) and modified them to meet the needs of my website.
* For the Readme file, I took the structure from my previous Readme file and used it here. Reference is given to https://github.com/dhakal79/Portfolio-project-MS1 which is the readme file I took into consideration when I was doing my first one.
* The icons; fa-solid fa-circle-check, fa-solid fa-circle-xmark and fa-solid fa-ranking-star came from Font Awesome.
* The ideas and code I implemented into this project were taught to me by Code Institute.
* My mentor Marcel Mulders supported me throughout the whole project. I couldn't have done it without his help.

Initially the color background for the wrong and correct answers aren't working.
The problem was that the priority in the css was wrong.
More priority was given to the black border and the white background in the css style above.
This bug was corrected by giving priority to the 'tick' class by adding in more classes.

By changing the 'section' elements to 'div' elements, the first three warnings disappeared. 'Div' elements don't require headings. By removing the 'text="text/javascript"' statement from the script source, the last two errors was resolved.
