# 1. User Experience

## 1.1 User Goals

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My goal in creating a menu for this project is to introduce people to the chinese culture especially the chinese cuisine. Chinese cuisine has been around for at least five thousand years. It has changed a lot over this long period of time but the essence remains the same. So, I wanted to share some of my country's famous dishes with everyone!

## 1.2 User Expectations

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The website should contain information about the chinese restaurant itself and the food it serves. It should contain descriptions of each dish and hopefully have an image of each dish.

The following are expected of this website:

* Should be easy to use and accessable on all electronic appliances.
* Should be visually appealing and contain the necessary information for the user.
* Should contain the address so that users of the website can locate the restaurant.
* Should contain contact information so that users can ask questions, book in or order food.
* Should be able to apply for a job at the restaraunt online.

## 1.3 Color Scheme and Font

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
### 1.3.1 Colors

The color scheme for this website are light colors. I think that the correct use of color is one of the key elements that attracts users to a website. In my opinion, I think light colors are more gentle on the eye when flicking through a website. I used the rgb color values as the main color inputs in my project.

### 1.3.2 Fonts

The way I decided on the font style was using google fonts. I inserted the name "Jin Li Wang" into google fonts and scrolled through the list until I saw the one that was the most suitable. It took a while but eventually I decided on the font below.

![Font Choose](assets/screenshot/screenshot-font-choose-1.png)
![Font Choose](assets/screenshot/screenshot-font-choose-2.png)
![Font Choose](assets/screenshot/screenshot-font-style.png)

I used different font sizes in my project based on the placement of items and pieces of code. The sizing adjusts itself according to the screen size. I think this is important as having a font that is too big on a small iphone screen will definitely decreases a visitor's appeal and opinion of the website.

## 1.4 Visual Images

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

I used pixabay as my main source of image gathering for my project. I feel like visual context is more appealing to visitors visiting my website since it is a food-based one. This would engage the visitors more and hopefully will attract them to actually book a table and try the dish out. 

Images also add to the quality of a website as it makes it more appealing to the eye by adding colors and shapes rather than words.

## 1.5 Skeleton Framework

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Invision was used to create the webframe and to brainstorm my ideas. I created four altogether, two for the webpage and two for an iphone screen.

I created three web pages altogether for my website, one for the home page, one for a survey page and one for a recruitment page. My ideas are presented below.
### 1.5.1 Front Page

# 2. Features

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 2.1 Same Features on all Three Web Pages

### Navigation Bar (Website Version)

The navigation menu is the same on all three web pages.
See the image below. 

![Nav Bar Website](/assets/screenshot/nav-desktop.png)

It consists of an orange background that is fixed to the top of the web page and had the name of the restaurant on it. The navigation links are in white on the right hand side and will 'light-up' when the mouse hovers over it.

### Navigation Bar (Mobile Version)

![Nav Bar Mobile](/assets/screenshot/navigation-link-mobile.png)

Similar to the web page navigation bar, the mobile version of the navigation bar is also orange. However, instead of the 'light-up' effect, the white letters just turn a deeper orange when hovered over. Also, instead of the navigation links being on the right hand side of the nav bar, an icon is there instead. When it is clicked, the navigation links will show up as below.

![Nav bar Mobile Open](/assets/screenshot/mobile-nav-open.png)

### Hero Image

The image I used as the "hero-image" of the three websites are the same. The only difference is that on the index.html page or the main webpage, I used the center part of the image whereas on the other two 'form' websites, the top of the image is used.

![Hero Image Center](/assets/screenshot/hero-center.png)
![Hero Image Top](/assets/screenshot/hero-top.png)

The mobile version of the home page are the exact same except that they are on a smaller scale but it still spans the width of the page as shown below.

![Hero Image Mobile Version](/assets/screenshot/heading-main-page.png)
## 2.2 Index.html

This page consists of the 'hero image' with the heading written on it, a menu, a drinks section, a contact information section, an iframe and a footer.

![Hero Image](/assets/screenshot/heading-main-page.png)

The menu is where the second navigation link brings you. It consists of a starter, a main course and a dessert section. 

![Starters Webpage](/assets/screenshot/starter-desktop.png)
![Starters Mobile](/assets/screenshot/starter-mobile.png)
The starters section is ddivided into three divisions. The Keep Running Project gave me this idea. The central block is where the starter dishes are listed and the two side blocks contain pictures of some of the starters.

![Main Course](/assets/screenshot/main-course.png)

The main course consists of a list of dishes that have a dropdown function. When you open them, a detailed explanation shows up and some of the dropdowns even contain an image of the dish.

![Main Course Open](/assets/screenshot/main-course-open.png )
![Dessert](/assets/screenshot/dessert.png)

The dessert is listed beside the main course on a webpage whereas on a mobile, it is listed below the main course.

![Drinks](/assets/screenshot/drinks.png)

The drinks section contains a fixed background of koi fish swimming. 

![Contact](/assets/screenshot/desktop-contact.png)

I separated the contact information section into three parts, one for contact details, one for address and one for opening times. On a mobile device, they will stack on top of each other.

![Contact Mobile](/assets/screenshot/mobile-contact.png)

![Map](/assets/screenshot/iframe.png)

The iframe shows the 'location' of the restaurant.(I just took a random place on the map) It is styled so that it would always take up the whole width of the page.

![Footer](/assets/screenshot/footer.png)

The footer section consists of links to facebook, instagram and twitter. It also contains a copyright logo. (An idea I took from the Coder's Coffeehourse Website)


## 2.3 Recruitment-form.html

The Recruitment Form consists of a navigation bar, a "hero image" and a form. The form asks for some personal questions like the name and age of the person applying, some of of their past experience and whether 
they are legible to work or not. The form scales itself according to the screen size it is displayed on. This is shown below:

![Form on Web Page](/assets/screenshot/desktop-form.png)

This is the layout of the form on a web page.

![Form on Mobile](/assets/screenshot/mobile-form.png)

This is the layout of the form on a mobile.

![Form on IPad](/assets/screenshot/ipad-form.png)

This is the layout of the form on an Ipad.

## 2.4 Survey.html

Other than the 'hero-image' and navigation bar, survey.html also contains a form, just like the recruitment-form above. The questions that are asked includes the number of times a customer visits the restaurant, the customer's favourite dishes, the number of people the customer usually comes with and how does the customer think of the restaurant's service. Some of these are multiple choice questions, and some are fill in the blanks. 

![Survey Website](/assets/screenshot/survey.png)

If you have filled the form out correctly, the image below would be shown.

# 4. Testing

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


## 4.1 Manual Testing

I manually tested by website using the 'inspect' tool built into the chrome browser that allowed me to view my website on different screen sizes.

### 4.1.1 Navigation Bar Test for All Three Web Pages

TEST            | OUTCOME                          | PASS / FAIL  
--------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------

### 4.1.4 Website Analysis on a Desktop using Lighthouse

The accessibility test of my website on a desktop is pretty good but I think I can improve it by reducing the size of the image I put it.

![Website Analysis on Desktop](/assets/screenshot/desktop-lighthouse.png)

### 4.1.5 Website Analysis on a Mobile using Lighthouse

I could definitely improve the accessibility of the mobile version by significantly reducing the size of the images I put in. The performance is ideally above 90. I would adjust this once all my grades are back.

![Website Analysis on Mobile](/assets/screenshot/mobile-lighthouse.png)

## 4.2 Testing with Tools

### 4.2.1 Am I responsive

I used the "Inspect" command on google chrome to check how responsive my website was with different screen sizes and appliances. These include:

- IPhone SE
- Iphone XR
- IPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- IPad Air
- IPad Mini
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo
- Galaxy Fold
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max

### 4.2.2 W3C Validator Tools

[W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the html codes of my project. It was used to check if any errors were available and I had to correct them before continuing onto the next step. The image below had to be shown in order to confirm that there is no error in my project.

![Confirmation-HTML](/assets/screenshot/w3c-html-pass.png)

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check that all the code written in css were correct. The image below tells me that there are no errors present in my code.

![Confirmation-CSS](/assets/screenshot/w3c-css-pass.png)

# 5. Bugs

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).

This showed up on my previous repository and I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong. I tried to change the setting and inserting new commands but this always shows up when I enter one. I created this new repository and copied and pasted everything from my previous repository to this one. Therefore all the commits I've made on this repository are from the same time. Also, in the beginning of this project I forgot to commit, I just saved everything I've done and continued on where I left off. I would start commiting from now on. All I've done in my previous file is the HTMl part of my project. I'm going to start my CSS part now. [11/07/2022 22:21]

## 5.1 Index.html file

![screenshot-1](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-bug-1.png)

I changed the "span" elements for "div" elements. This way, I got rid of the first four errors (1 - 4). So now, I know that the "ul" and "h1-h6" elements cannot be a child of the "span" element.

![screenshot-2](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-bug-2.png)

I deleted the height and width attribute from the wine image and placed it in the css tab. This got rid of the next two errors (5 + 6). I did the same thing with the "iframe" element, I deleted from the index.html file and transferred it to the css file. This got rid of error 7. For the last warning, I changed the "section" element to a "div" element because I don't think the "iframe" element needs a title. By doing all these steps, the image below showed up.

![screenshot-3](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-pass-1.png)

## 5.2 Recruitment-form.html

![screenshot-4](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-bug-3.png)

I deleted the "px" value from the end of the rows and cols, this got rid of the second two errors (2 + 3). There was an extra "/label" element behind the second address line that I deleted. By doing these steps, the bottom image was achieved.

![screenshot-5](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-pass-2.png)

## 5.3 Survey.html

![screenshot-6](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-bug-4.png)

I got rid of the "rem" value on the "textarea" element which then eliminated the second error. I inserted an id of "fav-starter" to the "datalist" element and I was successful in solving the third error. I got rid of the first two errors by adding in an "option" element which has a value of nothing. By completing the above steps, I successfully achieved the below image.

![screenshot-7](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-pass-3.png)

## 5.4 Style.css

![screenshot-8](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-bug-5.png)

I got rid of the "color" in "background-color" to get rid of the first and third error. I adjusted the "font-style" element to "font-family". After these two minor changes, the image below was shown.

![screenshot-9](/assets/screenshot/screenshot-pass-4.png)

# 6. Deployment

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The site was deployed to Github using the following steps:

- Sign in to Github.
- Create a respository and add in Code Institute template.
- Click on settings which is beside gitpod button on the navigation bar.
- Select pages on the left menu bar.
- Click on the main branch and save it.
- This will generate a live link in which your website can be found.
- The link to my website can be found [here](https://cw1224.github.io/Delicious-Chinese-Cuisine-in-Dublin/).

# 8. Improvements

If I were to do this project again, I would definitely spend more time on the @media part of the css stylesheets. This was the part I found to be the most time-consuming and thought-provoking. It was annoying how the margin kept goind out of place and how the screen would be more than 100% in width. Next time, I would definitely spend more time thinking about the webframe and adding in more details before I start writing the code itself. Planning is essential. That is the key feedback I would give myself after completing this project.

* For the navigation link, the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII was used and modified. I used his code initially but my results were different to his due to the amount of other styles I've added in beforehand. So I adjusted his original code and made it adjust to my website.
* For the Readme file, reference of https://github.com/dhakal79/Portfolio-project-MS1 was considered.
* The majority of dishes that I have on this menu came from my father. He is a chef and he has made beautiful chinese cuisine for our family overr the years. Some of these dishes can also be found in chinese restaurants all over Dublin.
* The fa-solid fa-bars-staggered came from Font Awesome.
