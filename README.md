# General Knowledge Quiz

Welcome to the readme file of my project.

## Introduction

This website is designed to test users on their general knowledge. The types of questions range from geographical locations and landmarks to historical people and famous events. By completing this quiz, users would be able to broaden their perspective of the world.

# 1. User Experience

## 1.1 User Goals

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My goal in creating this website is to broaden people's horizon. I want to either inform or reinforce their knowledge on different topics. The questions in this quiz would do just that. These questions test the user's knowledge of our solar system, the human history, geographical locations, our homeland, planet Earth and much more.

## 1.2 User Expectations

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The website should contain the quiz questions and options for the user to select an answer from. At the end of the quiz, the user should be able to get a feedback from the website regarding their overall score. 
The following are also expected of this website:

* Should be easy to use and accessable on all electronic appliances.
* Should be visually appealing and contain the necessary information for the user regarding how the quiz works.
* The questions should be written in simple English.
* The amount of time remaining to answer each question should be clearly visible.
* Should clearly show whether the user's selection is right or wrong.
* The question number the user is on should be clearly labeled.

## 1.3 Color Scheme and Font

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
### 1.3.1 Colors

The color scheme of this website are warm colors. This is designed to draw in first-time users and to leave an impression on users who have already visited the website. The initial picture of a hot air balloon is set in a sunset background. This is then folloed by two background images of autumn colors - the warm, orange color of autumn leaves and solden sunshine. The final background image appears when the results come out. It is the image of fireworks, a display that is usually watched by families and friends together. This is held in stark contrast from the white 'boxes' that the questions, options, information and results appear in. But this makes the actual content of the website stand out and overall the effects of the color scheme enhances the user's experience of the website.

### 1.3.2 Fonts

The fonts I used are the default font-family, the font-family 'Lobster' and the font-family 'Noto+Serif+HK'. I chose the 'Lobster' family to liven up the heading on the main-page where the website is. The font-family 'Noto+Serif+HK' is used to make the information section appear more 'professional'. The two families are shown below.

## 1.4 Visual Images

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

I used pixabay as my main source of image gathering for my project. The initial background-image, the background-images of the information section, of the quiz section and of the results section all increased the quality of the website and made it more appealing to the eye.

## 1.5 Skeleton Framework

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Invision was used to create the webframe and to brainstorm my ideas. I created eight altogether, four for the webpage and four for an iphone screen.

The leave button on the results page as seen below brings the user to the information page. When hovered over, it turns red in color.
![Leave Button Hovered](/assets/screenshots/hover-7.png)

## 2.2 Timer

The timer is set to run backwards from 10 to 0 seconds. It renews itself everytime the next question button is clicked. It also stops whenever the user clicks on an option. When the timer runs out, the user would no longer be able to select an option. The timer is located on the upper right of the quiz page.
![Timer](/assets/screenshots/timer.png)

## 2.3 Option effects

When the user hovers over an option, the bacckground-color of that option turns a pale yellow color.
![Option Hover](/assets/screenshots/hover-4.png)

When the user clicks on a correct answer, the color of the words and border color will turn dark green and the background would turn a yellow-green color. An icon, a green circle with a tick inside would appear at the end of the statment.
![Option Correct](/assets/screenshots/correct-answer.png)

When the user clicks on a wrong answer, the color of the words and border color will turn dark red and the background would turn a pink color. An icon, a red circle with a cross inside would appear at the end of the statment.

* Reference is given to [Coding Nepal](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingNepal) for teaching me how to make a quiz with timer. This was the video I took into consideration and I took some bllocks of code from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk) and modified them to meet the needs of my website.
* For the Readme file, I took the structure from my previous Readme file and used it here. Reference is given to https://github.com/dhakal79/Portfolio-project-MS1 which is the readme file I took into consideration when I was doing my first one.
* The icons; fa-solid fa-circle-check, fa-solid fa-circle-xmark and fa-solid fa-ranking-star came from Font Awesome.
* The ideas and code I implemented into this project were taught to me by Code Institute.
* My mentor Marcel Mulders supported me throughout the whole project. I couldn't have done it without his help.

Initially the color background for the wrong and correct answers aren't working.
The problem was that the priority in the css was wrong.
More priority was given to the black border and the white background in the css style above.
This bug was corrected by giving priority to the 'tick' class by adding in more classes.

By changing the 'section' elements to 'div' elements, the first three warnings disappeared. 'Div' elements don't require headings. By removing the 'text="text/javascript"' statement from the script source, the last two errors was resolved.
